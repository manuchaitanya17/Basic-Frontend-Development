<!-- CHAPTER-2- CHARACTER SET AND CHARACTER ENCODING -->

  <!-- A. CHARACTER SET
    1. A character set is a defined collection of characters, symbols, and glyphs that can be used in written 
       communication. 

    2. It encompasses letters, numerals, punctuation marks, special symbols, and more.

    3. Common character sets include ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), ISO-8859, Unicode, 
       and UTF-8. Each character set supports a specific range of characters. -->



  <!--B. CHARCTER ENCODING
    1. Character encoding is the process of representing characters from a character set as bytes or numerical 
       values as it has to be stored in computer memory.

    2. Since computers store and manipulate data in binary form(machine code), character encoding defines how characters 
       are translated into binary data that can be stored, transmitted, and processed.

    3. Different character encodings use different schemes to represent characters as numbers, and these numbers are 
       then stored as binary data. For example, the character "A" might be represented as the number 65, now if it has
       be stored or process in computer's memory then it has to be converted into binary data.

    4. Common character encodings include:
      a) ASCII: Uses a 7-bit encoding scheme and covers basic English characters.
      b) ISO-8859: A series of 8-bit encodings that extend ASCII to cover various languages.
      c) Unicode: A comprehensive character encoding standard that assigns a unique number (code point) to each character 
         in various scripts and languages.
      d) UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32: Encoding schemes within the Unicode standard that represent characters using variable 
         numbers of bytes.

      Note: UTF-8 is the most commonly used character encoding on the web because it supports the entire Unicode Character
      Set and is compatible with ASCII. It a  allows web pages to display text in multiple languages and writing systems. -->
