  <!-- A. HTML ATTRIBUTES
         1. HTML elements can have attributes.
         2. Attributes provide additional information about elements.
         3. Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
         4. Every name has some pre-built value that must be written within quotes.
         5. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value". 
         6. The name parameter takes the name of the property we would like to assign to the element and the value 
            takes the property value.
         
  
         7. HTML attributes are generally classified as: 
           a) Required Attributes: Required attributes are essential for an element to function correctly or 
              to provide meaningful information. If a required attribute is missing, the element might not work 
              as intended or might not be displayed properly.
              Example: The <img> element requires the 'src' attribute to specify the image source. Without it, the 
              image won't be displayed.
  
           b) Optional Attributes: Optional attributes are not essential for the basic functionality of an element. 
              They are used to enhance or customize the element's behavior, appearance, or accessibility.
              Example: The <a> element can include an optional 'target' attribute to specify where the linked page 
              should be displayed (e.g., in a new tab or the same tab).
  
           c) Standard Attributes: Standard attributes are attributes that can be applied to most HTML elements. 
              They provide recognising features to the element and also styling options for elements.
              Examples: id, class, style, title, lang, dir are standard attributes that can be used with various 
              HTML elements. 
  
           d) Event Attributes: Event attributes are used to execute JavaScript code with specific events that 
              occur on an element, such as clicking, hovering, or typing.
              Example: The onclick attribute can be used to define a JavaScript function that runs when a button is 
              clicked: <button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>. REFER eventAttribute.png
  
           e) Data Attributes: Data attributes are custom attributes that start with the prefix "data-". They allow 
              developers to store extra information about an element that can be accessed by JavaScript or CSS.
              Example: <div data-category="food">Pizza</div>. This can be accessed with JavaScript using 
              element.dataset.category.
  
           f) Boolean Attributes: Boolean attributes are attributes that do not require a value. Their presence alone 
              implies a certain state, typically a "true" state.
              Example: The disabled attribute on a button <button disabled>Click me</button> indicates that the button 
              is disabled.
  
           g) Global Attributes: Global attributes can be applied to virtually any HTML Element and are not specific to 
              any particular type of element.
              Examples: accesskey, contenteditable, hidden, spellcheck are global attributes that can be used with 
              various elements.
