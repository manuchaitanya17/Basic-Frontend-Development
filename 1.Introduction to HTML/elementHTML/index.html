 <!-- A. HTML ELEMENTS -->
  <!-- I. Structure: -->
  <!-- 1. An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. -->

  <h1> My name is Manu Chaitanya </h1>



  <!--II. Types of Elements(Structure): -->
  <!-- 1. Normal Elements: Element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. Never Skip the End Tag. -->

  <p> This is a Paragraph. </p>

  <!-- 2. Empty Elements: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). Empty elements do not have an end tag. -->

  <br>
  <hr>

  <!-- III. Types of Elements(Display): -->
  <!-- 1. Inline Elements: Inline elements are displayed on the same line. They do not start on a new line and take up     
          only as much width as their contents require. An example of an inline element is the <span> tag. -->
      
      
  <span>Highlighted</span>

  <!-- 2. Block Elements: Block elements take up the whole horizontal space available in its container. They start on a 
            new line and take up as much height as their contents require. An example of a block element is the HTML Paragraph Tag. -->

  <div>This is Block Element</div>

  
  <!-- IV. Types of Elements(Usage): -->
  <!-- 1. Semantic Elements: - Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain.
          - For example, tags like <header>, <article>, and <footer> are semantic HTML tags. They clearly indicate the role 
          of the content they contain.
  
          - Besides the obvious reason that semantic HTML tags are easier to read and understand—for example, by web developers 
            reviewing the code—there are two more specific reasons why you should always use semantic tags.

          - There are two types of Semantic Elements:
            a) HTML Semantic Element for Structure: Many semantic HTML tags communicate the layout of a page. These “structural” 
               tags were introduced when HTML4 got upgraded to HTML5. That's why they're also commonly known as semantic HTML5 
               tags or semantic HTML5 elements. Ex- <header>, <nav>.
  
            b) HTML Semantic Element for Text: The semantic HTML tags for text are HTML tags that—besides the formatting—also convey the 
               semantic function of the text they contain. Ex- <h1>, <p> etc.
               Note: REFER https://www.semrush.com/blog/semantic-html5-guide/ 
  
       2. Non-Semantic Elements: - Unlike, semantic elements they don’t have any meaning. They don’t tell anything about the content they 
          contain. They can be used with different attributes to mark up semantics common to a group. No special attributes are defined for such 
          elements.
          - Following is the list of some non-semantic elements:
              a) div
              b) span   -->


  
  <!-- IV. Nested Elements:
         1. HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
         2. All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
         3. The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>): -->
  
  <h1>Hello Manu, <span> Chaitanya </span></h1>



  <!-- V. Case Sensitive:
         1. HTML Elements are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>. -->

  <!-- VI. Difference between HTML Tag and Elements
         1. HTML Tag: Tags are the starting and ending parts of an HTML Element.
         2. HTML Elements: They consist of some kind of structure or expression. It generally consists of a start tag, content, and an 
            end tag. When a browser parses an HTML document, it creates a Document Object Model (DOM) based on the HTML elements within the 
            document. -->
