<!-- CHAPTER-1- INTRODUCTION TO HTML -->

<!-- A. WHAT IS HTML
      1. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
      2. HTML is the standard markup language for creating the structure of the Web pages.
      3. HTML consists of a hierarchy of elements.
      4. HTML elements tell the browser what actually to display in the content. 
      5. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
      6. Hypertext refers to text displayed on a computer or other digital device that contains
         links to other text/document. Hypertext Markup Language, is named "hypertext" because it allows the
         creation of documents containing hyperlinks, which are text-based links that connect one
         document or element to another. The term was coined by Ted Nelson in the 1960s and is one
         of the key concepts that makes the Internet work.
      7. The term "markup" refers to the practice of adding specific tags to text in order to define its 
         structure or presentation. In the context of HTML, the markup consists of HTML tags that are used to describe
         the different elements within a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. These tags 
         are not meant to dictate how the content should look visually, but rather to provide a structural framework 
         for browsers and other web technologies to interpret and display the content appropriately. -->
