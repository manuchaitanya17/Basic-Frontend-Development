<!-- CHAPTER-1- HTML ENTITIES -->

<!-- A. HTML ENTITES- INTRODUCTION
      1. Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with HTML Entities, or there are some characters not
         available on our keyboard to use, these are called Special Charcters.
      2. For example:  If we use the less than (<) or greater than (>), signs in our text, the browser might 
         mix them with tags.
      3. HTML Entities are used to display special characters/symbols in HTML. 
      4. HTML Entites can be represented as either Entity Name or Entity Number.
      4. A HTML entity looks like this: &entity_name;  OR  &#entity_number.
      5. Entity names are case sensitive.
      4. HTML Entities can be:
         a) Character Entites.
         b) Symbol Entities.
         c) Emojis Entities.  -->



<!-- B. CHARACTER ENTITES
      1. Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.
      2. A character entity looks like this: &entity_name;  OR  &#entity_number.
      3. For example: To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;
      4. Advantage of using an entity name: An entity name is easy to remember.
      5. Disadvantage of using an entity name: Browsers may not support all entity names, but 
         support for entity numbers is good.
      6. Character being represented can be of character-set:
           a) ASCII Characters.
           b) ISO 8859-1 Characters.
      7. All the HTML Enitity Number/Name of the Charcter: REFER: https://www.freeformatter.com/html-entities.html -->




<!-- C. SYMBOL ENTITES
      1. Many mathematical, technical, and currency symbols, are not present on a normal keyboard.
      2. To add such symbols to an HTML page, we can use the entity name or the entity number
         (a decimal or a hexadecimal reference) for the symbol.
      3. Symbols being represented can be of symbol from:
        a) ISO 8859-1 Symbols.
        b) Math Symbols.
        c) Greek Letters.
      4. All the HTML Enitity Number/Name of the Symbol: REFER: https://www.freeformatter.com/html-entities.html  -->




<!-- D. EMOJI'S ENTITES
      1. Since Emojis are characters, they can be copied, displayed, and sized just like any other character in HTML.
      2. If we want any of the emojis displayed in HTML, we can use the Entity Number represented in  decimal (dec) or
         hexadecimal (hex) reference.
