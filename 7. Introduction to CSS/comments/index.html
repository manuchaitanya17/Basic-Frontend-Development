<!-- A. COMMENTS 
    1. CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.
    2. A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */.
    3. Comments within CSS files are generally treated as text and are not parsed or represented in the CSSOM. -->
