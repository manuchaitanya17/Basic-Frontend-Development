  <!-- B. WHY DO WE USE CSS?
  1. Time Saving: We can write CSS once and reuse the same sheet on multiple 
     HTML pages.
  2. Search Engines: CSS is considered a clean coding technique, which means search 
     engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.
  3. Superior styles to HTML: CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so 
     you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML 
     attributes.
  4. Offline Browsing: CSS can store web applications locally with the help of an 
     offline cache. Using of this we can view offline websites. -->

     basic control over fonts, colors, and element positioning.

     positioning enhancements, and improved layout options.

     array of new features, including:
