<!-- CHAPTER-10 CSS !important -->

<!-- A. !important
  1. If we use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for
     that specific property on that element.
  3. The !important property in CSS is used to provide more weight (importance) than
     normal property. In CSS, the !important means that “this is important”, ignore
     all the subsequent rules, and apply !important rule and the !important keyword
     must be placed at the end of the line, immediately before the semicolon. -->
